# IoT-Based Wearable Health and Security Device

## Important Notice

This project is based on IoT development, utilizing hardware like the **ESP8266**. The project involves various libraries with deep directory structures that are critical for its operation. However, due to **operating system limitations**, particularly on Windows, where the maximum file path length is 260 characters, **I have not uploaded the project to GitHub**. All files and project resources are stored locally on my system.

### Why This Happens:
- **Long File Names**: IoT packages like the **ESP8266** come with long directory structures, and certain files have long names to support various configurations and examples. 
- **Windows File System Limitations**: Windows imposes a file path length limit of 260 characters, starting from the drive (e.g., `C:\`). Some files in the libraries exceed this length, causing errors like `Filename too long`, which prevents the project from being uploaded to GitHub.

### Current Status:
- **All Files are Stored Locally**: None of the project files, including code, libraries, or dependencies, have been uploaded to this GitHub repository due to these constraints. The project exists only in my local development environment.

### Solution for Users:
- To work with this project, you will need to manually install the necessary IoT libraries (e.g., **ESP8266**) on your local machine.
- Ensure that you place the project in a **short directory path** on your system to avoid file path length issues (e.g., `C:\Projects\IoTDevice`).

If you have any questions or need assistance with setting up the project locally, feel free to contact me.
